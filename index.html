      <h>Thoughts on a Rereading of: Life of Pi. </h>
      <p style ="background-color: red;"> The story of Life of Pi reflects on many topics such as religion, perserverance, and the socialital perceptions of being different than expected</p>
      <p>I just wanted to take a minute to write a few thoughts on the book and what it means to me personally. To me, Life of Pi is as close as an author can get to a perfect book. The story starts very patiently. The tremendous work that went into worldbuilding in the first half make the reader get absolutely lost in the perspective of our main character. The setting of being a zookeeper's son with such an admiration for the animals, does not feel alien on an initial reading. The reader easily and willing can place themeselves into the perspective of our lead.</p>
      <p>I could go on, but all I can say is go read the book! Completely is worth it!</p>
